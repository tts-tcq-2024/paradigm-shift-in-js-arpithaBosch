Key differences between old and new code:

1. Structure and Modularity
    Old Code:
      The original code had a single checker.js file handling value checks and test execution.
      All checks were performed using direct value comparisons without warning mechanisms.
    New Code:
      The functionality was modularized across multiple files (warnings.js, batteryManagement.js, main.js).
      A clear separation of concerns was established: warnings are calculated separately from the range checks, making the code more maintainable and scalable.

2. Configuration Flexibility
    Old Code:
      No configuration for warnings; all checks were hard-coded.
    New Code:
      The new implementation uses a configuration object to toggle warning functionality and set tolerances dynamically, allowing for more flexible and user-defined behavior.

3. Exception Handling
    Old Code:
      The original implementation used simple logging for errors.
    New Code:
      The new code throws errors when values fall outside of acceptable ranges, providing a more robust error handling approach.

4. Test Cases
    Old Code:
      Basic test cases were included to check if values were within range.
    New Code:
      Enhanced test cases validate both value checks and warning scenarios, ensuring comprehensive coverage of potential edge cases.


* Experience in writing the new code and was it feasible with exisiitng code:
1) Writing the new code was a systematic process that involved careful consideration of the existing structure and the desired enhancements. 
2) Breaking down the functions into distinct funtionalities required thoughtful planning to maintain code readability and efficiency.
3) The new feature of adding dynamic warnings was feasible given the existing structure of the code. 
4) The initial approach was straightforward, making it easier to expand functionality without compromising the original intent.
5) The modular structure allows for future enhancements or modifications without significant rewrites, which enhances the overall maintainability of the codebase.
